                        <p>I am Poliana Nascimento Ferreira, <b>teacher, researcher, and technology enthusiast</b>, working in
                            the areas of Artificial Intelligence (<b>AI</b>), Machine Learning (<b>ML</b>), Data Science, Data Structures,
                            and <b>Python</b>.
                        <p>My academic background is diverse and includes degrees in <b>Systems Analysis and Development</b>
                            (FIAP), <b>Physics</b> (UNINTER), and <b>Portuguese-English Language Studies</b> (UNICSUL). I hold a <b>master's
                                degree in Computer Science</b> (UFABC) and am currently pursuing a second <b>master's degree in
                                Physics</b> (UNICAMP).</p>

                        <p>Throughout my journey, I have had the opportunity to develop <b>research</b> and projects on topics such
                            as machine learning, quantum computing, wearable devices, and educational informatics. I am also
                            the <b>author of books</b> and educational materials in these areas.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, I am the co-founder and coordinator of AI Girls, a community that promotes female
                            leadership in the field of Artificial Intelligence. In this community context, I am an active

                                        <p class="description">With my growing interest in quantum computing,
                                            I decided to pursue a
                                            <b>second master's degree</b>, this time in <b>Physics at UNICAMP</b>. This choice was motivated by the
                                            realization that research approaches in Computing and Physics are
                                            quite different, and I wanted to also experience the academic environment
                                            in Physics to enrich my education and contribute to the field in the best
                                            way possible in the future.</p>

                                        <p class="description">My current project focuses on the <b>
                                            synthesis and optimization of operations in quantum computing</b>, using Machine Learning techniques, with an emphasis on <b>
                                                reinforcement learning</b>. The goal is to develop methods that reduce the number of
                                            operations to be performed on a quantum computer by converting them into
                                            fundamental gates in an optimized way. We started with classical ML, intending
                                            to also build quantum ML in the future. This research aims to
                                            contribute to the efficiency and applicability of quantum computers in
                                            real-world problems.</p>

                                            Internship course during my master's in Computer Science. This activity sparked
                                            my interest in teaching, leading me to work in different institutions and
                                            educational projects.</p>

                                        <p class="description">My first major project was in partnership with the

                                            In the Techne project, I taught <b>robotics classes</b> to 8th and 9th-grade
                                            students in a public school, teaching concepts of software and hardware. Over
                                            a year, we held a line-following robot competition, awarding the
                                            best group with computers. The project was a milestone in the city, receiving
                                            a <b>Motion of Applause in the City Council.</b></p>

                                            I participated in the <b>CERN Summer Internship</b>, an international program that
                                            offers lectures with leading experts in particle physics and the
                                            opportunity to develop innovative projects. This online internship
                                            highlighted my passion for the <b>integration between physics and computing</b>, one of the
                                            reasons that contributed to my selection. My project explored the use of
                                            <b>AutoML</b> to optimize hyperparameters in Machine Learning models
                                            applied to fast simulation of particle showers in calorimeters.
                                            We developed a metric to evaluate the model's performance, combining
                                            physical and computational validations, and tested different AutoML
                                            techniques.

                                        <p class="description">I developed a special interest in <b>technology events</b>, realizing that a technological community is a space for
                                            collective learning, experience exchange, and networking. In addition to actively participating, I have given lectures at more than 20 events and coordinated some of them,
                                            highlighting my role at <b>The Developer's Conference (TDC)</b>, one of the largest
                                            technology events in Latin America. I coordinated the Machine Learning track in the São Paulo edition for four years, contributing to content curation and
                                            organization.</p>

                                        <p class="description">Hackathons have also marked my journey. At Blue
                                            Hack, IBM's hackathon in 2017, I had my first contact with artificial
                                            intelligence. My group won 1st place with the Poran project, a
                                            virtual owl designed to converse and support hospitalized children.
                                            Later, at Accenture's hackathon, we also took 1st place with
                                            Economapp, an application that used computer vision to map items
                                            in users' refrigerators, suggest recipes, and promote products close to
                                            expiration dates in local supermarkets.</p>

                                        <p class="description">During Accenture's hackathon, I was invited to
                                            intern at the company, where I worked for six months developing a
                                            document recognition project using computer vision and
                                            TensorFlow. This period was remarkable as it was my <b>first contact with
                                                developing neural networks from scratch</b>, in 2017, consolidating my passion
                                            for artificial intelligence and deep learning.</p>

                                        <p class="description">After the experience in robotics, I started my first
                                            undergraduate degree in Systems Analysis
                                            and Development, venturing into a state more than 1,000 km from home at the age of 18. During the course, I learned to program in <b>
                                                Python,
                                                Java, front-end, explored IoT, artificial intelligence, project management, and
                                                the development of iOS and Android applications</b>. I conducted two

                                            game creation.</p>

                                            achieving 2nd place
                                            in both. For T-Systems, I developed a product control system in
                                            factories via chatbot. For Hospital Sírio-Libanês, I created "Almor", a

                                            providing feedback through an application.</p>
